      <p class="card-text">During one of the waterfront sessions my sports group and I went to the lake and my group
        of four were the first to go. We would get on the tube and then be taken out far into the lake where the driver then tried to
        make us fall off of the tube by making sharp turns and waves which made it really hard to stay on. After our
        turn was done we then were dropped off in the middle of the lake where everyone else was. For the remaining
        time we all hungout in the middle of the lake on surfboards with our sports coaches and our cabin counselors.

        <img src="images/ixdodge.jpg" class="dodgeball" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
        <p class="card-text">So in this game if you are either 15, 16, and 17 years old you will be put in what is called the IX age group which is what I was in this summer, and during one of the days during this week we
          have a big dodgeball game/match against the sports counselors. This was actually very fun even though we lost
          0-3 because before the match we all dress in all black clothing and then we put on body paint and do whatever
          we want with the designs. After we get ready we take pictures, videos and hangout for a little. Then we get to
          the dodgeball game and while we are playing we have the younger kids come and watch if they want which is
          pretty cool and this entire thing was really fun.

        <p class="card-text">Bible Study is not what it sounds like, at night we would have what was called Bible Study and it was basically a bois night were we would just hangout, stay up and just talk.  Now we had something called the broble and the broble was just a random book were you would swear to never break bro code and never talk about bible study to the girls and if you did you would be punished.  One day one of the bois broke this rule and had to get slappd in the thigh with a pin pong paddle by every dude in that side of the cabin, and that's pretty much what Bible Study is.</p>
